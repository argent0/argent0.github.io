		<h1>Medical Appointments No-Show</h1>
		<h1 id="exploring-no-show-data">Exploring No Show data</h1>

<p>This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA), of data describing medical
appointments.</p>

<p>The objectives are: first, to visually present the structure of the
sample data; and second, to show how the appointments' features relate
to whether the patients will show up nor not.</p>

<h2 id="medical-appointment-data">Medical Appointment Data.</h2>

<p>The appointments' characteristics present in the data are:</p>

<p>Some of them might require a short explanation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ScheduledDay</strong>: The day the appointment was scheduled.</li>
  <li><strong>AppointmentDay</strong>: The day of the appointment.</li>
  <li><strong>Neighbourhood</strong>: The Neighbourhood where the clinic is located.</li>
  <li><strong>Scholarship</strong>: 1 if the person receives
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsa_Fam%C3%ADlia">aid from the government</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Handcap</strong>: According to the source, A number that represents the person's
disabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>SMS_received</strong>: Whether the people received an SMS reminding them of the
appointment.</li>
  <li><strong>No.show</strong>: The value "Yes", means that the person missed the appointment.
The value "No", means that the person didn't miss the appointment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="computing-derived-features">Computing Derived Features.</h3>

<p>One of the factors that might be relevant to the show up ratio is the
length of time from the day the appointment was scheduled to the appointment
itself:</p>

<p><strong>Wait</strong> the number of days from the scheduling date to the appointment date.</p>

<h3 id="removing-malformed-records">Removing malformed records.</h3>

<p>Some rows with negative <code>Wait</code> or <code>Age</code> where ignored when performing the
analysis.</p>

<h2 id="exploration">Exploration</h2>

<p>This section contains the actual exploration of the data after having
established what features are present and removed the malformed records.</p>

<h3 id="some-numbers">Some numbers</h3>

<p>The first set of questions are about quantities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many appointments? 110 521 appointments.</li>
  <li>How many patients? 62 298 patients.</li>
  <li>Where do the appointments take place? In 81 different neighbourhoods.</li>
  <li>When were the appointments scheduled? From 2015-11-10 to 2016-06-08.</li>
  <li>When was the appointment? From 2016-04-29 to 2016-06-08.</li>
  <li>How many days did the patients had to wait? From 0 to 179 days.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-target-composition">The target composition.</h3>

<p>Now a visualization of the sample's composition. Starting with the proportion
of missed appointments, which is the target variable of the study. The data
shows that most patients don't miss their appointments.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/no_show_distribution-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk no_show_distribution" /></p>

<h3 id="features-composition">Features composition.</h3>

<p>It is also interesting to visualize the relation between the features and the
target.</p>

<p>Two questions about the features are explored: what is the feature's
distribution in the data?; and, what is it relation with the target?</p>

<p><strong>Gender</strong></p>

<p>There are almost twice as many women than men.
Both genders are equally likely to miss their appointments.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/gender_distribution-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk gender_distribution" /></p>

<p><strong>Patient's Age</strong></p>

<p>The patients' age distribution. The relation with whether they show up or don't
indicates that patients around the 15-20 age range are slightly more likely to
miss the appointment.</p>

<p>As expected, there are few samples for very old ages.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/hist_ages_2-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk hist_ages_2" /></p>

<p><strong>Waiting Time</strong></p>

<p>Most appointments are same-day or for the next day. Those
appointments also have better turn up. Lower waiting times appear to improve the
show up ratio.</p>

<p><em>Warning</em>, the histograms below have non-uniform bin sizes.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/hist_wait_2-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk hist_wait_2" /></p>

<p><strong>Distribution of Neighbourhoods</strong></p>

<p>There is considerable variance in the quantities of patients by neighbourhood,
but not so in the show up ratio.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/hist_neighbourhood-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk hist_neighbourhood" /></p>

<p><strong>Distribution of other categorical variables</strong></p>

<p>Most notably, it appears that patients that received an SMS (<code>SMS_received == 1</code>)
where also less likely to show up.</p>

<p>This is due the fact that patients with same-day appointments don't receive a
SMS and are, simultaneously the more likely to show up (maybe they already at
the hospital).</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/hists_categorical_variables-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk hists_categorical_variables" /></p>

<p>Actually, if we only consider appointments that don't occur the same day,
patients who received a SMS a bit more likely to show up.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/not_same_day_sms-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk not_same_day_sms" /></p>

<h2 id="some-characteristics">Some Characteristics</h2>

<p><strong>Are there patients with more than one appointment on the same day?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but most have only one.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>## Appointments per day
##     1     2     3     4     5     6     8    10 
## 94323  6531   739   157    33    18     1     1
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>How does showing up for the prevoius appointment predicts showing up for the
next?</strong></p>

<p>Patients that showed up for their previous appointment are more
likely to show up again. This is considering appointments on different days.</p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/previous_appointment-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk previous_appointment" /></p>

<h2 id="extragender-composition-by-age">[EXTRA]Gender Composition By Age</h2>

<p><strong>Why is the proportion of women so large?</strong></p>

<p><img src="/articles/2017-10-04/figures/exploration.md/age_by_gender-1.svg" alt="plot of chunk age_by_gender" /></p>

<p>There is a sharp drop in the proportion of men after the age of 16.</p>
