## Introduction

<!-- Narrative style
	- Like a guide for others to use. Without becoming a tutorial.

<!-- What's GSOC. -->

This document is the work product submission for the *Google Summer of
Code*(GSoC) 2021's edition. From their site:

> [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is  a global
> program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software
> development. Students work with an open source organization on a 10 week
> programming project during their break from school.

In this edition and for this project, my mentors
[@tarleb](https://github.com/tarleb), [@cderv](https://github.com/cderv),
[@apreshill](https://github.com/apreshill) and me
[@argen0](https://github.com/argent0) worked on improving figure support in
pandoc.

This was done under the umbrella of
[*haskell.org*](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5997747863289856/),
the organization representing the [Haskell Language](https://www.haskell.org/).

I took one of the four project proposed by the organization in its [Summer of
Haskell page](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html#pandoc-figures). In
particular, I submitted a [proposal](https://github.com/argent0/gsoc-2021-proposal)
to work in the [Pandoc Figures project](https://summer.haskell.org/ideas.html#pandoc-figures).

<!-- The pandoc proposal, a summary -->

<!-- About pandoc -->
### What is Pandoc?

Pandoc is  a  Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another,
and a command-line tool that uses this library.

Pandoc can convert between numerous markup and word processing formats,
including, but not limited to,  various  flavors of Markdown, HTML, LaTeX and
Word docx.

Pandocâ€™s enhanced version of Markdown includes syntax for tables, definition
lists,  metadata  blocks,  footnotes, citations, math, and much more.

![Pandoc's conversion logic\label{fig:native-rep}](/images/posts/2021/pandoc.svg)

Pandoc  has a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which parse text
in a given format and produce a native representation of the document (an
abstract syntax tree or AST), and a set of writers, which convert this native
representation into a target format.  Thus, adding an input or output format
requires only adding a reader or writer.  Users can also run custom pandoc
filters (*e.g*. [lua filters](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html)) to modify
the intermediate AST.

### Improving Pandoc's figure support

Before writing about improving figure support, it is necessary to mention what
do we mean by "figure" and what can pandoc do with them now.

#### On Figures

After studying various definitions of *figure* used by some of the formats
targeted by pandoc, we arrived to the following concept of *figure*:

> A part of the text document that is not part of the main flow of the text. It
> may contain a descriptive *caption* and it may be *referenced* in the main
> text.

This concept mostly results as a compromise of the definitions given in the
following formats:

* HTML
  [`<figure>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure)
  tag, "self-contained content, with an optional caption. It is referenced as a
  single unit".

* JATS
  [`<fig>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/element/fig.html)
  tag, "Block of graphic or textual material that is identified as a figure,
  usually bearing a caption and a label".

* LaTeX
  [floats](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions)
  , "not part of the normal stream of text, but separate entities, positioned in
  a part of the page to themselves".

It also attempts to capture pandoc's internal representation philosophy of
prioritizing *content* over *format*.

Finally, it's important to mention that figures aren't always images or
pictures. A poem in a book about poetry could be a figure.

#### Pandoc's original handling of figures.

Despite its internal representation lacking an *ad hoc* representation of
figures, pandoc's was capable of producing "figure" elements in its output. This
was achieved by treating an specific **construction** in a particular way:

```
[Para [Image ("", [], [("alt", "alt1")]) [Str "capt"] ("src", "fig:tit")]]
```

For example, here is pandoc 2.14 using the construction to generate HTML, LaTeX
and XWiki figures:

*HTML*

```
$ pandoc -f native -t html
[Para [Image ("", [], [("alt", "alt1")]) [Str "capt"] ("src", "fig:tit")]]
^D
```
```html
<figure>
<img src="src" title="tit" alt="alt1" alt="capt" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">capt</figcaption>
</figure>
```

*LaTeX*
```
$ pandoc -f native -t latex
[Para [Image ("", [], [("alt", "alt1")]) [Str "capt"] ("src", "fig:tit")]]
^D
```
```latex
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{src}
\caption{capt}
\end{figure}
```

*XWiki*
```
$ pandoc -f native -t xwiki
[Para [Image ("", [], [("alt", "alt1")]) [Str "capt"] ("src", "fig:tit")]]
^D
```
```XWiki
[[image:src||alt="capt" title="fig:tit"]]
```

The logic used by these `Writers` was:

*A paragraph containing a single inline image whose title has the `fig:` prefix,
is a figure*

This approach provides some benefit with its simplicity and the fact that it is
already in place. But it also presents issues.  In particular: it *leaves room
for interpretation on how to use it* to produce the "figure" element. Consider,
for example, the `title` element, the `tit` part of the `fig:tit`, in the
outputs above:

* It becomes the `title` attribute of the `img` tag in HTML. This attribute is
  what dictates the tooltip that shows up when hovering the mouse over the
  image.
* It is absent from the LaTeX output.
* It becomes the `title` in the XWiki output.

The issue being: the *same piece of text* is being used in the `Writers` to fill
*widely different roles*.

I believe this issue arises when the author of a `Writer` needs to interpret
the **construction** without explicitly defined roles for its parts. And that
compounded with what the output format can actually handle.

Nevertheless, the current figure support is very adequate for handling
figures consisting of an image and a "caption".

#### This proposal

Having established what we mean by "figure" and how pandoc currently handles
them, I think it is also important to mention that the
[discussion](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/3177) on adding figure support
to pandoc's AST goes back to 2016.

With this in mind, this project aimed to improve figure support by:

1. Extending pandoc's internal representation to capture information about
   figures.

2. Implementing full figure support for, at least, one input and output format.

3. *Optionaly*, implementing an interface usable by Lua (a *lua-filter*).

To achieve this, as detailed in my proposal, we:

* add a new *Constructor* to the type of pandoc's *AST*. The `Figure`
  constructor.

* formalize the previous construction used to represent figures consisting of
  one image by creating the `SimpleFigure` pattern synonym.

This originates from considering [prior
work](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/pull/83), the discussions so far and
my mentors' feedback.

## The `SimpleFigure` pattern synonym.

To address some of the issues with the previous handling of figures, we
introduced, along with some helper functions, the `SimpleFigure` [pattern
synonym](https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/pattern_synonyms.html)

```haskell
-- | Constructor for a figure with a single image.
--
-- It can be used to construct a figure:
--
-- >>> SimpleFigure nullAttr [] (T.pack "", T.pack "title")
-- Para [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("","fig:title")]
--
--
-- It can be used to pattern match:
--
-- >>> let img = Para [Image undefined undefined (undefined, T.pack "title")]
-- >>> case img of { SimpleFigure _ _ _ -> True; _ -> False }
-- False
-- >>> let fig = Para [Image undefined undefined (undefined, T.pack "fig:title")]
-- >>> case fig of { SimpleFigure _ _ tit -> snd tit; _ -> T.pack "" }
-- "title"
pattern SimpleFigure :: Attr -> [Inline] -> Target -> Block
pattern SimpleFigure attributes figureCaption tgt <-
    Para [Image attributes figureCaption
        (isFigureTarget -> Just tgt)]  where
  SimpleFigure attributes figureCaption tgt =
    Para [Image attributes figureCaption (second ("fig:" <>) tgt)]
```

This is very much like adding a new constructor to the `Block` type but with
some differences.

Some benefits of this approach are:

* It is backward compatible with the previous construction.
* It formalizes, without enforcing, the roles for the construction's elements.
* It makes it easier to find where are figures handled in the code for both
  `Readers` and `Writers`.

  Here is an example diff from the RST `Reader` in the [pandoc pull
  request](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7364):

  ```diff
  - return $ B.para (B.imageWith (imgAttr "figclass") src "fig:"
  -             caption) <> legend
  + return $ B.simpleFigureWith
  +     (imgAttr "figclass") caption src "" <> legend
  ```

Of course, there are also some limitations:

* It doesn't *enforce* the construction on new code, as an *actual constructor*
  would do. For example, code with non-exhaustive patterns matches won't rise a
  warning if `SimpleFigure` is not handled.

* It lacks an explicit `alt-text` field. This can be included using attributes,
  but I would have liked to give it more importance.

The code for the `SimpleFigure` pattern synonym was submitted with the
[pandoc-types pull request](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/pull/90).
Its use on `Readers` and `Writers` was submitted with the [pandoc pull
request](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7364).

I believe this is a modest improvement of the previous code. It provides an
explicit representation for figures. It could go a little further with an
explicit constructor; but keeping the behavior backward compatible prevents
breaking some workflows down the line, for example someone using a `lua-filter`.

Along the way, two other pull requests where submitted and merged to pandoc's
[main repository](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc):

* [The first](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7417) dealing with duplicated
  `alt-text` tags in the HTML output.

* [The second](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7425) closely related, dealing
  with HTML figure accessibility.

## The `Figure` constructor

The `SimpleFigure` constructor only addressed one type of figures, the ones with
only one image in them. To address the general case of the concept of a document
within a document detailed in the section on figures, we introduced the
following `Block` constructor:

```haskell
data Block =
	-- ...
	-- | Figure, with attributes, caption and caption position, width
	-- (optional), and content (list of blocks)
	| Figure Attr Caption [Block]
	-- ...
```

This includes other helper functions and tests and is part of the [pandoc-types
pull request](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7364). It's based on the
previous work by [@despresc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-types/pull/83).
Modifications include: the removal of the `CaptionPos` argument that can be
specified as an attribute; and the code involving tables.

Tests for this constructor are also included with the pull request.

This constructor allows pandoc to capture the semantics of figures from
different formats into its internal representation. It also helps when writing
output in formats that support figures.

The code using this constructor in pandoc is part of the [pandoc pull
request](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/pull/7364).

### Reading input with figures

Reading figures is now supported for two formats natively and one format through
a Lua filter. This functionality has to be enabled with a new [pandoc
extension](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extensions): `native_figures`.

```
#### Extension: `native_figures` ####

Use pandoc's native `Figure` element for content inside `<figure>` tags, in the
case of HTML, or `figure` environments, in case of LaTeX. This, in turn, allows
some writers to produce more accurate representations of figures. It also
allows the use of the `Figure` element in filters, for custom figure output.

This extension can be enabled/disabled for the following formats:

input formats
: `latex` `html`
```

The choice of an extension was made to introduce the new behaviour with minimal
disruption of the old one.

#### Reading HTML 5 figures

This version of pandoc can now read figures from HTML into its internal
representation:

*Now*
```
$ pandoc -f html+native_figures -t native
<figure class="important">
  <img src="../media/rId25.jpg" />
  <ul> <li> ITEM </li> </ul>
  <figcaption> CAP2 </figcaption>
</figure>
^D
[Figure ("",["important"],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "CAP2"]])\
	[ Plain [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("../media/rId25.jpg","")]
	, BulletList [[Plain [Str "ITEM"]]]]]
```

The difference with the old handling is that, now, elements inside a figure are
not limited to only one image:

*Before*
```
$ pandoc-before -f html -t native
...
^D
[Para [Image ("",[],[]) [Str "CAP2"] ("../media/rId25.jpg","fig:")]]
```

Notice the missing `ITEM`. Handling of attributes and classes has also become
more granular and accurate. Notice the missing `important` class above.

#### Reading LaTeX figures

It can also read LaTeX figures:

*Now*
```
pandoc -f latex+native_figures -t native
\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics{test/media/rId25.jpg}
      \caption{CAP1.1}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
      \centering
      \includegraphics{test/media/rId25.jpg}
      \caption{CAP1.2}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{CAP1}
    \label{fig:inner1}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
    \includegraphics{test/media/rId25.jpg}
    \caption{CAP2}
    \label{fig:inner2}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{CAP}
  \label{fig:outer}
\end{figure}
^D
[Figure ("fig:outer",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "CAP"]]) 
	[ Figure ("fig:inner1",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "CAP1"]])
		[ Figure ("",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "CAP1.1"]])
			[Plain [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("test/media/rId25.jpg","")]]
		, Figure ("",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "CAP1.2"]])
			[Plain [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("test/media/rId25.jpg","")]]]
	, Figure ("fig:inner2",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "CAP2"]])
		[Plain [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("test/media/rId25.jpg","")]]]]
```

It captures the figure and sub figure hierarchies, labels and captions
accurately.

*Before*

```
pandoc -f latex -t native
...
^D
[Para [Image ("",[],[]) [Str "CAP1.1"] ("test/media/rId25.jpg","fig:")]
,Para [Image ("",[],[]) [Str "CAP1.2"] ("test/media/rId25.jpg","fig:")]
,Para [Image ("fig:inner2",[],[]) [Str "CAP2"] ("test/media/rId25.jpg","fig:")]]
```

Figures with sub-figures where flattened into a list of figures using the
construction mentioned in the original figure handling section. Some captions
and labels are lost.

#### Markdown figures

Handling of markdown figures was implemented through a Lua filter. We opted for
this approach because there is yet no agreed-upon syntax for figures in markdown
(for example commonmark). Pandoc has its own markdown flavor but we have also
opted to propose our syntax by implementing it as a filter. The code of the
filter has been submitted in the [lua-filters pull
request](https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters/pull/187).

I've written two filters that represent two possible markdown syntax extensions
to represent figures. Both use pandoc's markdown `div` syntax with special
classes.

##### The explicit caption syntax

```markdown
::: { .figure }

content.

:::: {.caption }
caption
::::

:::
```

In this syntax a figure is a pandoc div with a `figure` class and the caption,
if present, is a div with a `caption` class.

Here is an example that converts this to HTML

```
$ pandoc -f markdown -t html --lua-filter=../lua-filters/markdown-figures/md-figure-explicit.lua
...
```

```html
<figure>
<p>content.</p>
<figcaption><p>caption</p></figcaption>
</figure>
```

##### The implicit caption syntax

```markdown
::: { .figure }
figure content

figure caption.
:::
```

This, more concise, syntax uses the last paragraph inside the div as the caption
for the figure.

```
$ pandoc -f markdown -t html --lua-filter=../lua-filters/markdown-figures/md-figure-implicit.lua
...
```

```html
<figure>
<p>figure content</p>
<figcaption><p>figure caption.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Generating output with figures.

Once figures can be described in pandoc's internal representation, it is the
`Writers` that translate them into various output formats. Not all output
formats can represent figures, and for those that can, we have decided to focus
on the ones that would make the least intrusive modifications first.

Next, I'll briefly enumerate the output resulting from the `Figure` constructor
in various formats.

#### HTML


```
% pandoc -f native -t html5
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Plain [Str "caption"]]) [Para [Str "content"]]]

^D
```
```html
<figure id="fig-id">
<p>content</p>
<figcaption>caption</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Figures are represented as `<figure>` tags.

#### Org mode format

```
% pandoc -f native -t org
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing []) [Para [Str "content"]]]
^D
```
```org
<<fig-id>>
content
```

Emac's org mode adds an anchor to the content of the figure.

#### Textile

```
% pandoc -f native -t textile
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing []) [Para [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("foo.png", "")]]]
^D
```
```html
<figure id="fig-id">

!foo.png!


</figure>
```

The textile format constructs an HTML5 figure.

#### Texinfo

```
% pandoc -f native -t texinfo
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[])
	(Caption Nothing [Para [Str "Caption"]])
	[Para [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("foo.png", "fig:")]]]

^D
```
```texinfo
@node Top
@top Top

@float Figure
@image{foo,,,Caption,png}
@caption{Caption}
@end float
```

GNU Info's figures.

#### RST

```
% pandoc -f native -t rst
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Para [Str "Caption"]])
	[Para [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("foo.png", "fig:")]]]

^D
```
```rst
.. container:: float
   :name: fig-id

   .. figure:: foo.png
      :alt: 
```

Figures are represented as containers.

#### Markdown


```
% pandoc -f native -t markdown
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Para [Str "Caption"]])
	[Para [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("foo.png", "fig:")]]]
^D
```
```markdown
::: {#fig-id .figure}
![](foo.png)
:::
```

Figures are represented as a pandoc div with the `.figure` class.

#### MediaWiki


```
% pandoc -f native -t mediawiki
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Para [Str "Caption"]])
	[Para [Image ("",[],[]) [] ("foo.png", "fig:")]]]

^D
```
```mediawiki
<div id="fig-id" class="figure">

[[File:foo.png|thumb|none]]


</div>
```

Figures are represented as a div with the `figure` class.

#### Jats


```
% pandoc -f native -t jats
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing [Para [Str "Caption"]]) [Para [Str "Text"],
Para [Image ("fig-id-2",[],[]) [] ("foo.png", "fig:")]]]

^D
```
```jats
<boxed-text id="fig-id">
  <p>Text</p>
  <fig id="fig-id-2">
    <graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="png" xlink:href="foo.png" xlink:title="" />
  </fig>
</boxed-text>
```

Figures are represented with the `boxed-text` tag in JATS.

#### XWiki

```
% pandoc -f native -t xwiki
[Figure ("fig-id",[],[]) (Caption Nothing []) [Para [Str "content"]]]

^D
```
```xwiki
(((
{{id name="fig-id" /}}content
)))
```

Figures are represented as groups.

#### Other formats

All other formats handle figures like they handle pandoc's divs.

## Testing

All of these changes have associated tests. Some of them have been used here as
examples.

## Trying it out

The code for this version of pandoc can be found in [this
branch](https://github.com/argent0/pandoc/tree/figures-gsoc) and can be built
using the pandoc's build system.

I've made a linux binary pre-release available on
[Github](https://github.com/argent0/pandoc/releases/tag/figures-gsoc).

## Conclusion

I would like to conclude this document expressing my gratitude to all the people
involved in making this project possible. From the people of the Haskell
community to the GSoC's organizers. I would like to specially thank my mentors:
Alison, Albert & Christoph for the advice, help and support.

This has been a very fun project where I've had the opportunity to learn many
things along the way. I hope there are many more open source contributions to
come.

Thanks for reading.
